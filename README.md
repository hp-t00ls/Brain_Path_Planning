Path planning for navigation and guidance 

GitHubâ€™s "Download ZIP" option does not support downloading LFS files. 
The downloaded archive will include only pointers to the LFS files, not the actual files themselves. 
That is why the Tractography 1.obj is not directly accessible...
The Tractography being to volumenous, do a git pull once you are located on the unzipped repo...
